$Chord Trainer â€” Concept Overview
## Purpose
The Chord Trainer is an interactive tool designed to help musicians (especially pianists and keyboardists) improve their chord recognition, finger placement, and speed. By generating random chords and requiring the user to play them on a MIDI keyboard, it provides a fun and effective way to practice and test musical skills.

## Core Features
Random Chord Generation:
The app randomly selects chords from a comprehensive list, including major, minor, and diminished chords in all keys.

MIDI Input Detection:
The user connects a MIDI keyboard. The app listens for played notes and checks if the correct chord is played.

Scoring System:
Points are awarded based on how quickly the user plays the correct chord after it appears. Faster responses earn higher scores.

Session Timer:
Each training session is time-limited (e.g., 60 seconds), encouraging quick thinking and fast recognition.

Progress Tracking:
The app displays the current chord, notes required, score, and time left in the session.

## Planned Enhancements
Chord Images:
For each chord, display a visual diagram (e.g., piano keys highlighted) to help users visualize finger placement.

Difficulty Levels:
Group chords into levels (e.g., Beginner: major/minor triads; Intermediate: 7th chords; Advanced: diminished/augmented, extended chords). Users can select their level.

Downloadable Practice Packs:
Allow users to download chord lists or session results for offline practice.

Performance Analytics:
Show stats such as fastest chord, most missed chord, and progress over time.

## Example User Flow
Start Session:
User clicks "Start". A random chord (e.g., "F# minor") is displayed.

Play Chord:
User plays notes on their MIDI keyboard. The app listens and checks for the correct chord.

Score & Next Chord:
If correct, the app awards points based on speed, then displays a new random chord.

Session End:
After the timer runs out, the app shows the final score and stats.

Educational Value
Ear Training:
By associating chord names with their sound and finger positions, users improve both recognition and muscle memory.

Sight Reading:
Visual chord diagrams help users quickly identify and play new chords.

Motivation:
Gamified scoring and levels encourage regular practice and improvement.
